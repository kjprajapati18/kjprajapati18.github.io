# RK Math Notes

  This website was a joint project between me and my friend, and although it is currently in an abandoned state, it is something that I would like to revisit later on and recode to see my progress.

  Both of us had a strong passion for math, yet we noticed that many students in our district seemed to struggle to understand key concepts since they are unable to visualize the problems. Without a visual understanding, it's virtually impossible to gain an intuitive understanding of these concepts. Since we used to be members of National Honor Society and Mu Alpha Theta Math Honor Society in high school, we decided to help some of our high school friends by creating a website for them.

  My friend did most of the planning in terms of what topics we should put on the site and how people should be able to navigate through the pages. I helped him with the planning by showing him some of the stuff that I already knew how to do, as well as suggest different layouts for visual explanations.
  
  Even though we collaborated a lot on the logistics, the task of actually creating the website based on our ideas was primarily left to me. I finished the basic skeleton of the website before my friend abandoned the project. I continued the project for a little while to see how far I could get with my knowledge of programming at the time.
  
  I look forward to coming back to this project sometime in the future, but for now, I will be focusing on improving my object-oriented programming skills.
